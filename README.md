## Overview

Hi 🤙 In this project, you'll build a SaaS application that converts full podcasts into viral short-form clips ready for YouTube Shorts or TikTok. The tool uses different AI models to transcribe the video, automatically detect the most engaging moments in podcasts and create clips cropped to the active speaker's face. You'll learn how to build a complete production-ready SaaS with user authentication, a credit-based payment system using Stripe, and background processing queues to handle user load. All services used in this project are free, so you won't have to pay anything to follow along. We'll use technologies such as Next.js 15, React, Typescript, Tailwind CSS, ShadCN, Auth.js, Python, FastAPI, Stripe, Modal, Inngest, S3 on AWS, and more
